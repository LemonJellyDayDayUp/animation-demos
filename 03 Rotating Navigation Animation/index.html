      <h1>A private conversation</h1>
      <small>New Concert English 2</small>
      <p>
        Last week I went to the theatre.
        I had a very good seat.
        The play was very interesting.
        I did not enjoy it.
        A young man and a young woman were sitting behind me.
        They were talking loudly.
        I got very angry.
        I could not hear the actors.
        I turned round.
        I looked at the man and the woman angrily.
        They did not pay any attention.
        In the end, I could not bear it.
        I turned round again.
        'I can't hear a word!' I said angrily.
        'It's none of your business,' the young man said rudely.
        'This is a private conversation!'
      </p>
